Motivation

This project was born out of a love for games and programming. We wanted to create a simple yet fun game that can be played right in the console. The thrill of the slot machine, the anticipation of the spin, and the joy of winning are all encapsulated in this project. 

Features
Interactive Gameplay: The game prompts you for your input at each step, making you a part of the game rather than just a spectator.

Customizable Bet Amounts: You can choose how much you want to bet per line, giving you control over how much you want to risk and how much you could win.

Multiple Lines: You can play on multiple lines, increasing your chances of winning.

Randomized Spins: Each spin is completely random, just like a real slot machine.

Winning Calculations: The game calculates your winnings for you, so you can focus on the fun part: playing the game!

Retry Mechanism: If you enter an invalid bet, the game gives you another chance to enter a valid one.

End Game Option: You can choose to end the game after each round, giving you the freedom to play as long or as short as you want.
